# 🎧 Spotify EDA Project (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify tracks using Python and explores patterns in genre, popularity, energy, danceability, and more.

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the structure and key audio features of Spotify tracks
- Analyze top genres and trends in track popularity
- Explore relationships between audio features (e.g., energy, danceability)
- Visualize key insights using matplotlib and seaborn

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Pop, EDM, and Dance Pop are the most common genres
- Danceability and Energy are moderately correlated (~0.6)
- Loudness strongly correlates with Energy
- Most songs are around 3.5 minutes long — aligning with commercial music standards
- Songs with high energy/danceability tend to be more popular

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to clean, explore, and visualize real-world music data
- How to interpret correlation matrices and generate insights
- How to present results in a structured, readable way
